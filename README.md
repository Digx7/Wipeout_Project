# Wipeout_Project
After fantasy tactics I wanted to try and make something different.  I wanted to make a wipeout clone in which you could customize the look of your ship.  The idea was that as you progress through the game you would unlock new parts for your ship which could give you different upgrades/abilities.  Luckily I was able to find a wipeout clone project that was made by Synert, you can find his repo here https://github.com/Synert/WipeoutClone.  So much of the ship controller code is thanks to him.  What I built is the customization system and the one race track.
