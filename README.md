# Wipeout_Project
After fantasy tactics I wanted to try and make something different.  I wanted to make a wipeout clone in which you could customize the look of your ship.  The idea was that as you progress through the game you would unlock new parts for your ship which could give you different upgrades/abilities.  Luckily I was able to find wipeout clone project that was made by some guy over 2 years ago from when I started this project.  So much of the ship controller code is thanks to him.  What I built is the customization system and the one race track.
